# Data sources & licensing

ESGMap's numeric headline metrics are ingested from authoritative open datasets by
[`scripts/build-data.mjs`](scripts/build-data.mjs). Each source is normalised on ISO-3166
alpha-3 codes, mapped to the Natural Earth `name` used by the map, and stamped with the date it
was retrieved. The full provenance table (with retrieval dates) is also rendered live in the
app's **Methodology** view.

Countries with no upstream value for a metric are emitted as `null` and render grey / "no data"
in the UI — figures are never fabricated.

## Live, ingested metrics

| Metric(s) | Source | Endpoint | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| Renewable electricity share, grid carbon intensity, electricity use per capita, electricity mix, 2000→latest history | **Our World in Data — Energy** (compiled from Ember and the Energy Institute Statistical Review) | `raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/energy-data/master/owid-energy-data.csv` | CC BY 4.0 |
| CO₂ per capita | **Our World in Data — CO₂ & Greenhouse Gas Emissions** (Global Carbon Project) | `raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv` | CC BY 4.0 |
| Forest cover (% land) | **World Bank** `AG.LND.FRST.ZS` (FAO Forest Resources Assessment) | `api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS` | CC BY 4.0 |
| Air quality (PM2.5, µg/m³) | **World Bank** `EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3` (WHO / IHME Global Burden of Disease) | `api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3` | CC BY 4.0 |

## Curated, dated layer (slow-moving / categorical)

These fields update rarely and are maintained as a curated JSON
([`scripts/country-meta.json`](scripts/country-meta.json)), compiled from the cited public
authorities. They are versioned in-repo and carry the same retrieval stamp.

| Field(s) | Authority |
|---|---|
| Paris Agreement status, 2030 NDC target | UNFCCC NDC Registry; Climate Watch (WRI) |
| Net-zero target year | Net Zero Tracker (Oxford / ECIU); Climate Watch |
| IFRS S1 / S2 adoption, ESG regime | IFRS Foundation jurisdiction profiles; IOSCO |
| EV sales share | IEA Global EV Outlook |
| Climate-risk exposure (0–100) | ND-GAIN Country Index |
| Region, capital, tier | Compiled reference metadata |

## Derived metric

**Sustainability score (0–100)** — a transparent composite, not a third-party index. It is a
weighted blend of normalised sub-scores, renormalised over whichever are available per country:

| Weight | Sub-score | Transform |
|---|---|---|
| 30% | Clean-power share | renewable % (0–100) |
| 25% | Grid carbon | `100 × (1 − min(carbon / 800, 1))` |
| 20% | CO₂ per capita | `100 × (1 − min(co2pc / 25, 1))` |
| 15% | Disclosure readiness | blend of Paris ratification, net-zero pledge, IFRS S1/S2 (rich tier only) |
| 10% | Climate risk | `100 − climate` |

The exact weights live in `scripts/build-data.mjs` (`SCORE_WEIGHTS`) and are surfaced in the
Methodology view.

## Reproducing the dataset

```bash
npm run build:data     # re-ingest the live feeds → src/data/countries.json
npm run build:meta     # regenerate the curated layer from the design handoff (rarely needed)
```
